<h1>Persistence of vision project using TLC5940 grayscale LED driver and
  BeagleBone Black</h1>

<p>One of my good friends has a masive NYE party every couple of years. This
year the theme was "lights," and guests were encouraged to have costumes or cool
stuff related to the theme. I got a BBB in November with a plan to make a
massive, ~760 light display. I really wanted to learn to use the BBB's two
Programmable Realtime Units, and I also needed grayscale control of the LEDs,
for which the only good through-hole option seemed to be TI's TLC5940 LED
drivers. After a lot of work I realized that I didn't have enough time to finish
that project before New Years. Thanks partly to  <a
  href="http://ch00ftech.com/2011/10/24/led-persistence-of-vision-toy/">this
  post</a>, I found that I could use a lot of the work I'd done to construct a
simple persistence of vision display.</p>

<p>This is one of my first electronics projects, and I had to learn about a lot
of different things. In almost every case, my choices were motivated by the
desire to learn and understand exactly how and why everything worked, rather
than aiming for efficiency or architectural quality. I'm very pleased with the
way this turned out--often if I choose a project with a too-steep learning curve
I never finish it at all--but there are many things about this project that
still need substantial work.</p>

<p>After I had successfully <a
  href="http://derekmolloy.ie/gpios-on-the-beaglebone-black-using-device-tree-overlays/">set
  up the PRU pins</a> and run the <a
  href="https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package">examples</a>, I
decided to try to make a simple assembly program to bit-bang the TLC5940
grayscale cycle. I was very lucky to find an <a
  href="https://sites.google.com/site/artcfox/demystifying-the-tlc5940">open-source
  book</a> describing the protocol to use and linking to a <a
  href="http://mythopoeic.org/BBB-PRU/am335xPruReferenceGuide.pdf">programming
  flow chart</a> published by TI but inexplicably hard to find via the
documentation for the TLC5940. Using these two resources and TI's <a
  href="http://mythopoeic.org/BBB-PRU/am335xPruReferenceGuide.pdf">PRU-ICSS
  Reference guide</a>, I started working on an assembly version of the
protocol.</p>

<p>The way the PRUs work from the BBB is that you write a program for the PRU(s)
in assembly, then write a C program that runs on the BBB main processor that
loads the compiled binary of the assembly program into the PRU, starts it
running, and does any necessary communication via interrupts. The examples
provided on github demonstrate the project structure and include makefiles to
compile the assembly programs along with the C and warn about errors. While I
had a fair amount of confusion once I started trying to actually program in
assembly, I really appreciated having simple project templates and a one-step
build process.</p>

<p>The PRU instruction set is pretty small, consisting of 40 or so different
instructions, and the provided compiler also allows the definition of macros and
structs. From a programming standpoint I found the hardest part was structuring
the code nicely, and I'd still like to refactor more to get the modularity I'd
like. Macros seem able to do about 75% of what I'd like from functions, and what
I ended up with is, honestly, covered in red sauce and frequently paired with
meatballs. I am also indebted to the authors of the prudebug project on
sourceforge, without which I'd have been stuck with my original debugging
methods involving LEDs, transistors, goat blood and pentagrams.</p>

<p>This was an extremely fun project, and I really enjoyed having a small-ish
test project to get me started with the TLC5940 drivers. I'm going to use what I
learned in this project toward the original idea I had, about which more
(hopefully) soon.</p>
